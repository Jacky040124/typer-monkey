Refactor CSS to Tailwind

The refactor must not alter the existing visual appearance in any way.

After each refactor step, use the browser’s inspection or preview tools to verify that the layout, spacing, and styles remain identical to the original design.

Only proceed to the next step after confirming there are no visual changes.
